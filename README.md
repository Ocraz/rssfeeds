# rssfeeds
My personal security feeds divided into:
* pentest / hacking feeds
* security podcasts and videos
* security feeds in Dutch
* security advisories
* other security feeds
* privacy and data protection feeds

I'm using Feedly (https://feedly.com) for reading, storing and exporting my feeds.
